## 🚀 The Vision
Billions of rupees in government funds go unutilized every year simply because citizens don't know they are eligible. **Awsar Setu** changes that.

We are building a **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** that acts as a bridge between the Government's intent and the Citizen's benefit. Whether you are a farmer in Kalahandi or a student in Mumbai, Awsar Setu ensures you never miss an opportunity that is your right.
